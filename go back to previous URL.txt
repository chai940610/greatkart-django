once in the cart page, and user didn't sign in, so when the user tekan checkout, we want the page redirect to the checkout page.

hereby the solution
1) install the request
	pip install requests

2) import requests to te views.py
	import requests

3) then use this thing
	url=request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER')	#HTTP_REFERER is grab the previous URL from where you came

4) query=requests.utils.urlparse(url).query
